## Introduction
"Escape The UE Project" is a surreal exploration game where a player finds themselves trapped inside an unfinished Unreal Engine project. The game blends familiar mechanics with bizarre, glitchy environments, challenging players to navigate through a series of increasingly surreal levels to finally escape the confines of a broken digital world.

## Documentation of the Game
This game begins in a basic Unreal Engine first-person shooter template, requiring players to utilize both platforming and shooting mechanics to progress. Each level introduces new "glitches" or mechanics, designed to emulate common development bugs or unfinished features, turning them into gameplay elements:
1. **Start Level**: Utilize jumping and shooting to navigate and break through a wall with a missing texture.
2. **Look Up**: Triggered by looking up and pressing 'F', launching the player upward to reach the goal.
3. **Parkour Launch**: Use parkour skills and launchpads to navigate to the level's end.
4. **Invisible Maze**: Navigate through an invisible maze designed as an abstract art gallery.
5. **DeathFloor**: Follow a hidden path guided by mannequins running from a threat; stepping off the path results in falling.
6. **de_pasir**: Dodge mannequins in a homage to the famous Counter-Strike map "de_dust", with mannequins posing threats with laser weapons.
7. **MyHouse**: Explore a surreal version of a house, interact with dancing mannequins, and discover easter eggs.
8. **Final Level**: Navigate through a repeating and degrading environment that eventually "crashes" the game as a form of escape.
